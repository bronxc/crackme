Most simple project. This console app expects the user to type the password
`hunter23`, and accepts if so, and rejects if not. The goal is to bypass this
check and always continue to the success logic branch.

Usage
-----

Compile with gcc/visualstudio/whatever. Open in your favorite dissassembler and
patch the executable code. Run again for the win.
