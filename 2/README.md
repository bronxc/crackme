Note: this is just a first pass :)

Pretty simple project. This console app expects the user to type their own
name, then put in a corresponding password (ostensibly emailed or whatever).
The goal is to bypass this check and always continue to the success logic
branch. A good exercise would be to also write a reversing mechanism.

Usage
-----

Compile with gcc/visualstudio/whatever. Open in your favorite dissassembler and
patch the executable code. Run again for the win.
